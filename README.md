# Web Page App Frontend Written in Yew

This is the frontend written in Yew. The plan is to have this application download linked Markdown files from the Web Page backend and then use a "Paint/GIMP" like art application (written using Yew and html Canvas elements) to allow the user to draw on these elements as a new way of building and designing web pages. There will also be a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) repl like interface for modifying the Markdown Html and CSS. I don't know if there will be any plans on allowing the user to modify how Post requests as that starts to get complicated.
